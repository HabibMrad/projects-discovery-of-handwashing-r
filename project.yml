description    : >
  Reanalyse the data behind one of the most important discoveries of modern medicine: handwashing.
long_description: |
  In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery:
  He discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever
  and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives. 

  In this R project we will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected.
  This project assumes you can manipulate data frames using `dplyr` and make
  simple plots using `ggplot2`. You can learn these skills in the course 
  [Introduction to the Tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse).
